Capturing an internship's daily tasks and learning outcomes could not be any easier with the help of 'InternMatch'

In a highly regulated and compliant industry, ensuring all daily internship tasks are documented for both the student and the education providers is paramount in ensuring a successful outcome for all students.

The interactive 'InternMatch' app allows real-time completion of daily tasks during any type of internship. The app allows education providers to keep track of each student and the things they're doing as part of their internship.

Host companies and business supervisors use the app to approve each logbook entry made by their interns to confirm the legitimacy of the internship without the requirement of keeping track of manual books and paper that is easily lost or damaged!
